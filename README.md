Camera Azimuth

The principle of operation of the web application "coordinatecam.vercel.app" is to determine the geolocation using a camera on any device. 
With this application, you can take a photo or video with the camera on your device and the application will automatically determine the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of that location. 
You can then use these coordinates for various purposes, such as location tracking, adding geotags to photos, or other geolocation-related tasks.
